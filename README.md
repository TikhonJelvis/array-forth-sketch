# GreenArrays with the Sketch compiler

Here are some simple utilities for synthesizing GreenArray programs using the Sketch compiler and synthesizer.

This depends on both the [sketch frontend](https://bitbucket.org/gatoatigrado/sketch-frontend/) and the [sketch backend](https://bitbucket.org/gatoatigrado/sketch-backend/). It also depends on my Haskell [array-forth](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/array-forth) libraries which you can get on cabal. You'll have to use version >=  0.2.0.6.
